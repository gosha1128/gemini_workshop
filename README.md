# Introduction

The code in this repository is part of the hands-on tutorial portion of GSI Technology's Gemini APU Workshop.

I've included here instructions on how to setup and run everything.

# Prerequisites

You need the following:
* An Ubuntu Linux 18.04 machine with Python3.6 installed
* An attached Leda-G board ( it should have already passed at least 1 iteration of dev_diagnostics and you should know its local ip address )
* Gemini Software version 100.9.10.2-rc
* GNLPY version 00.17.00
