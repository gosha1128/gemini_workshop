# Introduction

The code in this repository is part of the hands-on tutorial portion of GSI Technology's Gemini APU Workshop.

The workshop is composed of the following parts:
1. Exploring The RF Signal Dataset
2. Training A Deep Learning-based RF Signal Vectorizer
3. Implementing KNN-based Similarity Search For RF Signal Identification Using Gemini

The following instructions will detail how to install and run the workshop components.

# Exploring the RF Signal Dataset

In this part of the workshop, participants will learn:
* basic python programming
* basic use of jupyter notebooks
* some exploratory data analysis and visualization skills

## Prerequisites

You will a machine with the following installed:
* python3
* jupyter notebook support 
* the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) command line utilities

## Installation

Follow these installation steps:
* clone this repository to your machine:

```git clone ```

* use the GCP tools to download the dataset to your machine:

```>> gsutil -m cp gs://deepsignal//gemini_workshop//exploring_the_radioml_dataset .```

# Training A Deep Learning-based Signal Vectorizer

## Prerequisites

For "Training A Deep Learning-based Signal Vectorizer", you need:
* a machine with Python3 and Jupyter Notebook support ( we use Colaboratory in the workshop )
* an attached GPU is preferred

# Implementing KNN-based Similarity Search For Signal Classification On Gemini

## Prerequisites

* An Ubuntu Linux 18.04 machine with Python3.6 installed
* An attached Leda-G board ( it should have already passed at least 1 iteration of dev_diagnostics and you should know its local ip address )
* Gemini Software version 100.9.10.2-rc
* GNLPY version 00.17.00
