    "\n",
    "### - Join us in the training room if you are in Sunnyvale.  Otherwise, join us via Zoom.  Use the following Zoom Meeting URL https://zoom.us/j/227454565\n",
    "\n",
    "### - You will need access to your own computer during the training session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - You do not need to install anything.  Just make sure you have an updated web browser.  We prefer Google Chrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - During the session, you will be remotely connected to a machine where we have simulated the Gemini hardware.  In the next Gemini practice session, we will use real hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - During the session, you will be running and editing code within your browser using the tool you see here.  It's called Jupyter.  I will take you through a quick tutorial during the sesion.  But if you want to get a head start - try to figure out how to run the code below.  If you are successful, you will get a surprise!\n"
